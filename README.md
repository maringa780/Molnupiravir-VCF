# Molnupiravir / MK-4482 / EIDD-2801 VCF files
This repository contains annotated VCF files of lung biopsy mutations from uninfected (*n*=2), infected vehicle treated (*n*=4) and infected Molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801) treated (*n*=4) samples (see citation below for details).
If you don't have a software to uncompress '.tar' and '.gz' files, download and install *'unzip_untar.exe'* from https://github.com/maringa780/IBCsignature to uncompress the VCF files in *'VCF.tar.gz'*.
